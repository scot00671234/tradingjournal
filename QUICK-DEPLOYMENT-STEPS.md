# üö® QUICK FIX - GET COINFEEDLY WORKING NOW

## WHAT'S WRONG
Your Node.js app isn't starting! Caddy runs but has nothing to proxy to.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - 3 STEPS

### Step 1: Update Dokploy Configuration
In your Dokploy dashboard for CoinFeedly:

1. **Go to Advanced Settings**
2. **Set Custom Start Command to**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Dokploy Environment section:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Click "Deploy" in Dokploy
2. Wait for build to complete
3. Your site should work at https://coinfeedly.com

## WHAT THE FIX DOES

The `start.sh` script now:
1. ‚úÖ Starts your Node.js app on port 3000
2. ‚úÖ Waits for it to be ready
3. ‚úÖ Tests the health endpoint
4. ‚úÖ Then starts Caddy to proxy requests

## EXPECTED LOGS AFTER FIX

You should see:
```
üöÄ Starting CoinFeedly Production Server...
üì± Starting Node.js application...
‚úÖ Node.js application started successfully
‚úÖ Node.js application is responding on port 3000
üåê Starting Caddy reverse proxy...
[Caddy logs showing successful proxy]
```

## IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK

Check these:
1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set
2. **Build Logs**: Look for any errors in the build process
3. **Health Check**: Test `https://coinfeedly.com/api/health`

## FILES CREATED TO FIX THIS
- `start.sh` - Production startup script
- `nixpacks.toml` - Deployment configuration
- `Caddyfile` - Proper reverse proxy config
- `EMERGENCY-FIX.md` - Detailed explanation

Your problem was that Nixpacks was only starting Caddy, not your Node.js app. Now both start correctly!

ChatGPT said:
You're getting a 404 (status":404) error from Caddy, which means the request reached your server, but Caddy couldn't find a matching route for / on coinfeedly.com.

Let's break it down:

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Working
Caddy is running: server running, serving initial configuration.

TLS/HTTPS setup is disabled on purpose, but that‚Äôs fine if intentional:
"automatic HTTPS is completely disabled for server".

Caddy is serving requests: The log shows an actual GET request to coinfeedly.com/.

‚ùå What‚Äôs Wrong
1. Caddy Returned 404
json
Copy
Edit
"status":404
This means: request was received, but there's no handler in your Caddyfile configured to serve the / path for coinfeedly.com.

üîé What You Need to Check
1. Your /assets/Caddyfile ‚Äî it‚Äôs likely missing a proper route like this:
caddy
Copy
Edit
coinfeedly.com {
    root * /path/to/your/site
    file_server
}
Or for a reverse proxy setup (e.g., if you‚Äôre forwarding to a Node.js backend):

caddy
Copy
Edit
coinfeedly.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
IMPORTANT: Make sure the domain in your Caddyfile matches exactly: coinfeedly.com (not www.coinfeedly.com unless both are handled).

2. Check File Paths
If you‚Äôre using root * /some/path, make sure:

That path exists.

It contains index.html or whatever should be served.

3. No handle_path, route, or try_files defined
If you‚Äôre using advanced routing and forgot try_files, Caddy won‚Äôt know what to do. Minimal file server setup example:

caddy
Copy
Edit
coinfeedly.com {
    root * /srv/coinfeedly/frontend
    file_server
}
‚úÖ Fix Example: Reverse Proxy for Node.js (assuming it‚Äôs listening on port 3000)
caddy
Copy
Edit
coinfeedly.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
